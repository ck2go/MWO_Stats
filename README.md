# MWO Stats

**Status**: proof-of-concept

MWO Stats might become a Python library for statistical analysis of MWO end of 
round screenshots (and maybe more). 
So far it is just a proof-of-concept script.


## Installation

No installation routine yet as it is in proof-of-concept stage right now.


## Usage

Simply edit the parameters in the script as needed and run

```bash
 python mwo_stats.py
 ```

## ToDo
- [ ] Add option to ignore pilots in analysis
- [ ] Add menu if Mech is not recognized
    - [ ] 1.) ignore
    - [ ] 2.) rename
    - [ ] 3.) add chassi
- [ ] Add match-id
- [ ] Add match date and time
- [ ] Add sqlite database to separate match and player information
